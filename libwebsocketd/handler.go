// boundary refused everything (nothing EvalSymlinks returns starts with
// "./"), while a ".." boundary accepted anything still spelled with a
// leading "../" — exactly what a symlink pointing out of the tree resolves
// to. That failed OPEN, disclosing a file outside a relative --staticdir
// and executing one outside a relative --cgidir.
//
// filepath.Abs collapses ".." lexically, before any symlink is resolved.
// That is the intended reading for the boundary — the operator's own flag

// boundary joined with an already-rooted, cleaned request path, so it
